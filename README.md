# Library-Simulation-Solving-Deadlocks-Starvations
This project solves the deadlock and starvation problem using semaphores and mutex in C. 

Project assumes 100 students come to study at a library and total of 10 rooms available to study.
Each room has 4 students capacity. Each student works and spends some time in the library and the main problem here
is when all rooms are full, a deadlock happens. This project solves this problem using semaphores and mutex.
